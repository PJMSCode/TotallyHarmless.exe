# TotallyHarmless.exe – Nuisanceware Collection

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
> This project is for **educational and entertainment purposes only**.  
> These scripts are intentionally non-destructive. They demonstrate how simple code can create chaos on an endpoint, highlighting the importance of **endpoint monitoring, privilege management, and user awareness**.  
> Think of it as "malware’s goofy cousin" — annoying, not harmful.

## 🎭 What is Nuisanceware?
"Nuisanceware" is software that doesn’t steal or destroy data, but instead:
- **Wastes time**
- **Frustrates users**
- **Simulates attacker behaviors** in a safe, controlled way  

It’s like prankware for sysadmins, competitions, or classrooms — but each script ties back to a **real security lesson**.
