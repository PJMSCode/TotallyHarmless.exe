## 🎭 What is Nuisanceware?
"Nuisanceware" is software that doesn’t destroy or steal data, but instead **wastes time, frustrates users, or produces funny (but safe) effects**.  
Think of it as a prank toolkit for sysadmins, CTFs, and friends with a good sense of humor.

Examples might include:
- Randomly moving the mouse pointer 🖱️  
- Playing the Windows error sound at random intervals 🔔  
- Inverting the screen colors every 60 minutes 🎨  
- Spawning a Notepad window that types *"HELLO THERE"* by itself 📄  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Safe by design (no data deletion, no networking, no persistence).  
- Modular scripts for Windows/Linux.  
- Written in a mix of PowerShell, Python, and Bash for variety.  
- Easy to extend — just drop in your own nuisance module.
